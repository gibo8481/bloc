        <h1 class="full-width-title">From Concept to Creation</h1>
        <p class="full-width-subtext">Four students from the ATLAS Institute came together for their senior capstone to create a product that would inspire the next generation of makers. We wanted to lower the barrier to entry for fabrication by designing something joyful, simple, and empowering.

            As makers and engineers, we know how thrilling it is to bring an idea to life. But fabrication tools often require complex software or intimidating hardware. bloc aims to flip that narrative—removing friction so users can dive straight into creating.</p>

    <!-- Precedent Research -->

        <div class="text">
            <h2>Precedent Research</h2>
            <p>We began by researching existing fabrication tools and maker kits. Platforms like Tinkercad, Chomp Shop, and BitsBox inspired us with their focus on beginner accessibility and hands-on learning. However, we found that these tools were catered towards younger audiences. We saw an opportunity to create something for older beginners—middle schoolers, teens, and adults—who want to build fabrication skills without needing prior experience. Our goal was to bridge the gap between playful introduction and real-world making.</p>

        <h2 class="centered-title">Sketching</h2>
        <p class="centered-subtext">We sketched a wide variety of ideas for both the console and the enclosure. Our goal was to explore different forms, aesthetics, and user flows. The console sketches focused on housing all the necessary components while remaining intuitive to use. The enclosure sketches emphasized safety, ease of access, and how it would visually coexist with the console in a shared space.</p>

    <!-- CAD Models -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>CAD Models</h2>
        <p>We began with a primary wooden enclosure design, exploring features like a hinged lid for material access and built-in dust management. Through iterations, we refined the form into a more compact, "bloc"-like shape—emphasizing rounded, inviting edges. The console design evolved alongside it, ensuring alignment in both style and function.</p>

            <h2>Prototyping & Iteration</h2>
            <p>We began by assembling the machine and testing it together as a team—getting a feel for how users might interact with the system. With a rough version of our Innovation Guide, we invited users to try the device and provide feedback on clarity, ease of use, and overall experience.</p>

    <!-- Human Experience Testing -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Human Experience Testing</h2>
        <p>To refine the console interface, we created a rough physical prototype that allowed users to place buttons and controls where they felt most natural. This helped us understand user expectations and ergonomics early in the process.</p>
        <div class="image-row">
            <img src="../img/hx-testing-1.jpg" alt="Testing Image 1">

            <img src="../img/hx-testing-4.jpg" alt="Testing Image 4">
        </div>
        <p>From the human experience testing, we gained insights into how users naturally interact with the interface. These placements informed our design iterations, which focused on layout, ergonomics, and ease of use. As the console evolved, we aligned its form and visual style with the enclosure—creating a cohesive and inviting interaction experience.</p>

    <!-- Enclosure Prototyping -->
    <section class="section with-image">
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Enclosure Prototyping</h2>
            <p>Our first enclosure was a quick prototype made from 3D-printed parts and MDF. From this version, we learned that the drawer was unnecessary and that a shop-vac-style hose system would be more effective for dust collection.</p>

        <p>The second prototype featured more refined 3D-printed parts designed for easy assembly using screws. We replaced the drawer with a wooden base and backing, which added stability and simplified the design. This version served as a functional test unit—allowing us to run the machine and console together and showcase the system in action.</p>

    <!-- Iteration through Feedback -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Iteration through Feedback</h2>
        <p>We continued refining the enclosure and console side-by-side—rebuilding, testing, and tweaking as we went. With each version, we also tested the updated Innovation Guide to ensure the experience remained accessible, intuitive, and fun.</p>
