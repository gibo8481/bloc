            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <div class="step">
                <div class="step-header">
                    <div class="step-number">1</div>
                    <h3>Draw Your Design</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content">
                    <p>Start by sketching out your design. You can follow the template above by cutting out the design and tracing it onto your material or sketching it out by hand. The material size should allow you to draw both pieces on one piece of plywood.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <div class="step">
                <div class="step-header">
                    <div class="step-number">2</div>
                    <h3>Secure Materials</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content">
                    <p>Open the lid on your bloc enclosure. Place the sacrificial material (in this case, cardboard) with your plywood on top on the aluminum bed. Use the clamps to secure the pieces in place. Make sure there is no room for them to move around while you are cutting. Close the lid.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 3 -->
            <div class="step">
                <div class="step-header">
                    <div class="step-number">3</div>
                    <h3>Start Cutting: Align Spindle</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content">
                    <p>With the bloc console, select the travel mode and use the X-Y Axis Joystick to move the spindle so that it is hovering over the lines you drew in Step One. It is best to start in one corner of your design and move around the edges.</p>
                    <p>Now, select the cut mode. Turn the spindle on with the Power Switch. Lower the Z Axis Joystick so that it is cutting all the way through the material. It is okay if it hits the cardboard, that is why it is there!</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Before cutting, ensure that the spindle is far enough to cut through your material without touching the aluminum bed below.</p>
                    <p>At this time, you can also turn on the vacuum to remove any dust particles.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cutting the Material:</strong> While in cut mode, use the X-Y Axis Joystick to follow the path that you drew. During this time, you will be able to see if your spindle is deep enough into the material. If it is not cutting all the way through, use the Z Axis Joystick to lower it. Continue cutting all around the edges until the piece is fully cut out.</p>
                    <p><strong>Repeat:</strong> Once you have fully cut out one of the pieces, turn off the spindle. Use the Z Axis Joystick to raise the spindle out of your material and switch to travel mode. Align the top of the spindle with the other piece you have drawn. Repeat the cutting process until the second piece is fully cut out.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 4 -->
            <div class="step">
                <div class="step-header">
                    <div class="step-number">4</div>
                    <h3>Remove and Assess</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content">
                    <p>When you are finished cutting, turn off the spindle and the vacuum. Raise the spindle and open the lid on your bloc enclosure.</p>
                    <p>Loosen the clamps to remove the material and sacrificial material. Interlock your two pieces as shown in the picture above. Place your phone in the stand, and it is ready to go!</p>
